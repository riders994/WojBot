# WojBot
This is a Discord Chatbot that interacts with my fantasy league, and can be useful for real life stuff as well.

Right now, it's at barebones. Barely anything is up. It can do basic echo, some math, and other small silly things.

As far as Fantasy functions, it currently runs the draft lottery. The current security session is only to let me personally run it. Will figure out a way to fix this in the future.
